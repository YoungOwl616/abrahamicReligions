            <h2 id="history-h2">A Brief Rundown On Christianity</h2>
            <p class="history-para">
                This history of Christianity is focussed on the life, death and resurrection of one person, Jesus Christ, the son of God.
                The traditional story of Jesus tells of his birth in a stable in Bethlehem in the Holy Land, to a young virgin called Mary 
                who had become pregnant with the son of God through the action of the Holy Spirit.

                The story of Jesus' birth is told in the writings of Matthew and Luke in the New Testament of the Bible.

                His birth is believed by Christians to be the fulfilment of prophecies in the Jewish Old Testament, which claimed that 
                a Messiah would deliver the Jewish people from captivity.
            </p>

            <p class="history-para">
                After the story of his birth, little is known about Jesus until he began his ministry at the age of about 30.

                He then spent three years teaching, healing and working miracles.

                He taught in parables - everyday stories which had divine messages for those who would hear it.

                He had twelve disciples whom he called to follow him and help him in his work.
                Jesus stated publicly that he spoke with the authority of God.

                This claim angered the religious authorities in Palestine and they handed Jesus over to the Roman authorities as a revolutionary.

                He was tried for heresy, condemned and put to death by means of crucifixion.
            </p>

            <p class="history-para">
                On the Sunday following his execution, some of his women followers discovered that the tomb into which his body had 
                been placed was empty.

                Jesus then appeared to them, alive, as the Jesus they had known prior to his death. His followers realised that God had 
                raised Jesus from the dead.

                Jesus was seen by many of his disciples and followers over the next few days before, according to the Gospel accounts, 
                he was taken up into heaven.
            </p>

            <p class="history-para">
                It has been suggested that the work of Jesus Christ and the impact of his death and resurrection would not have made any lasting impact on the world were it not for the missionary work of Paul.

                The account of Paul's conversion to Christianity is contained in the New Testament book, the Acts of the Apostles.

                Before his conversion Paul had been known as Saul and had been violently opposed to the Christian faith as taught by Jesus and after his death, by his disciples.

                Saul experienced a dramatic conversion, known as the Damascus Road conversion, when he was temporarily blinded.

                He found himself filled with the Holy Spirit and immediately began preaching the Christian gospel.
            </p>

            <p class="history-para">
                Paul's teaching centred on understanding the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ as a central turning point in history.

                He understood the resurrection to signal the end of the need to live under Jewish law.

                Instead Paul taught of living in the Spirit in which the power of God was made to work through human flesh.

                Some of his letters to fledgling churches throughout the Roman Empire are contained in the New Testament and outline Paul's theology.

                He insisted that Gentiles had as much access to the faith as Jews and that freedom from the Law set everyone free.

                It was this teaching which was essential for the development and success of the early church which would otherwise have remained nothing more than another Jewish sect.

            <p>Jesus, also referred to as Jesus Christ or Jesus of Nazareth (among other names and titles), was a first-century 
                Jewish preacher and religious leader; he is the central figure of Christianity, the world's largest religion. 
                Most Christians believe he is the incarnation of God the Son and the awaited Messiah (the Christ) prophesied in the 
                Hebrew Bible.

            <p class="holy-book-para">
                The Bible is a collection of religious texts or 
                scriptures that are held to be sacred in Christianity, Judaism, Samaritanism, and many other religions. 
                The Bible is an anthology – a compilation of texts of a variety of forms – originally written in Hebrew, 
                Aramaic, and Koine Greek. These texts include instructions, stories, poetry, and prophecies, among other 
                genres. The collection of materials that are accepted as part of the Bible by a particular religious 
                tradition or community is called a biblical canon. Believers in the Bible generally consider it to be a 
                product of divine inspiration, but the way they understand what that means and interpret the text can vary.
