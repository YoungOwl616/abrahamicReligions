            <p class="history-para">
                The origins of Judaism date back more than 3500 years. This religion is rooted
                in the ancient near eastern region of Canaan (which today constitutes Israel
                and the Palestinian territories). Judaism emerged from the beliefs and practices
                of the people known as “Israel”. What is considered classical, or rabbinical,
                Judaism did not emerge until the 1st century CE
            </p>

            <p class="history-para">
                Judaism traces its origins to the covenant God made with Abraham and his
                lineage—that God would make them a sacred people and give them a land.
                Judaism, Christianity, and Islam share this Abrahamic heritage and are
                often referred to as being Abrahamic religions. In other words, they all claim
                descent from the practices of the ancient Israelites and the worship of the “God
                of Abraham”. The primary figures of Israelite culture include the patriarchs
                Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and the prophet Moses, who received God’s Torah at
                Mount Sinai.
            </p>

            <p class="history-para">
                Historically, Judaism went from being a religion practiced primarily in and
                around the lands that are modern Israel up to the year 70 CE to one practiced
                in lands beyond due to the exile and forced dispersal of Jews. It also evolved
                from a religion centered in religious practice in the two great temples, to
                rabbinic Judaism and religious worship and education in synagogues.
            </p>

            <p class="history-para">
                Rabbinic Judaism has been the mainstream form of Judaism since the 1st
                century. It is based on the belief that Moses received God’s Torah in two forms;
                the Written Torah (Pentateuch) and an oral explanation, known as the Oral Torah,
                that Moses transmitted to the people.
            </p>

            <p class="history-para">
                Rabbinic Judaism contrasts with Sadducees, Karaite Judaism, and
                Samaritanism, which do not recognize the oral law as a divine authority nor
                the rabbinic procedures used to interpret Jewish scripture.
            </p>

            <p class="history-para">
                Judaism is a tradition grounded in the religious, ethical, and social laws as
                they are articulated in the Torah—the first five books of the Hebrew Bible. Jews
                refer to the Bible as the Tanakh, an acronym for the texts of the Torah, Prophets,
                and Writings. Other sacred texts include the Talmud and Midrash: the rabbinic,
                legal, and narrative interpretations of the Torah.
            </p>

            <p class="history-para">
                Rabbinic Judaism is also based on the emergence of rabbi’s as leaders, the study
                of the Torah, and thrice daily prayer.

            <p class="holy-book-para">
                The Hebrew Bible contains the Torah, or Five Books of Moses, the Nevi’im
                comprising the books of the Prophets, and the Ketuvium, or additional writings. 
                Originally the Bible was copied onto scrolls, but from about the 7th century the 
                text was also copied into books. Masorah, a grammatical system of vowels, accents,
                and marginal notes, was developed to preserve the correct transmission and recitation
                of the text. To this day Torah scrolls for use in services are without vowels.
            </p>

            <p class="holy-book-para">
                The earliest Jewish prayer-book dates from the end of the 9th century. The Haggadah, 
                or service book for Passover Eve, was originally part of the prayer-book but became an 
                independent book some time in the 13th century. It is frequently illustrated.
            </p>

            <p class="holy-book-para">
                Jewish legal codes include concise versions of religious and secular laws from the Torah 
                and the Talmud, the primary source of ancient rabbinic law. The earliest known code dates 
                from the late 11th century.
