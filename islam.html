            <p class="history-para">
                Islam is one of the world's major religions, along with Hinduism, Judaism, Buddhism and Christianity.

                Since its birth in Arabia more than 1,400 years ago it grew rapidly, making a profound impact on philosophy, 
                literature, the arts, science and medicine throughout history.
            </p>

            <p class="history-para">
                Today, an estimated 1.1 billion people worldwide are Muslims and the Islamic traditions they follow are as varied as the 
                nations where they live.

                Islam's central teaching is that there is one all-powerful, all-knowing God, who is referred to by the Arabic name, Allah. 
                In Arabic, Islam means "surrender," or "submission," to the will of God.
            </p>

            <p class="history-para">
                Islam was founded by the prophet Mohammed, who was born in Mecca around A.D. 570 and settled in Medina around 622. 
                Muslims believe Mohammed was the last and most important in a series of prophets, including Abraham, Moses and Jesus.

                The holy book of Islam is the Koran, which means "the timeless words of God."
            </p>

            <p class="history-para">
                The core practices are known as the Five Pillars -- daily prayer, faith, fasting, pilgrimage and alms giving.

                Performing the Hajj is the fifth pillar of Islam. Hajj means to set out for a place and for Muslims that place is Mecca. 
                It is mandatory for every Muslim to make the journey at least once in a lifetime. Over 2 million Muslims made the pilgrimage 
                in 2005.

                The two main branches of Islam are Sunnism and Shi'ism.

                Muhammad was an Arab religious, social, and political leader and the founder of Islam. According to Islamic 
                doctrine, he was a prophet divinely inspired to preach and confirm the monotheistic teachings of Adam, Abraham, 
                Moses, Jesus, and other prophets. He is believed to be the Seal of the Prophets within Islam. Muhammad 
                united Arabia into a single Muslim polity, with the Quran as well as his teachings and practices forming the basis
                of Islamic religious belief.

            <h2 id="holy-book-h2">Islam's Holy Book: The Qur'an</h2>
            <p class="holy-book-para">
                Muslims believe that the Qur'an, the holy book of Islam, was revealed to Muhammad over a period of twenty-three years, 
                starting with the initial revelation at Mount Hira. After the Prophet's death, his successors compiled these divine 
                revelations in a manuscript.
            </p>

            <p class="holy-book-para">
                The Qur'an contains prayers, moral guidance, historical narrative, and promises of Paradise. It opens with a short prayer 
                called the Fatiha, the most widely recited passage, and is divided into 114 chapters (suras) organized in descending length. 
                For binding and reading purposes, manuscripts of the Qur'an are often divided into thirty equal parts, called juz'.
            </p>

            <p class="holy-book-para">
                Every chapter of the Qur'an (except one) begins with the bismillah, the collective name for the invocation "In the name of 
                God, the Compassionate, the Merciful." Muslims often repeat this phrase at the start of an event or task—before giving a 
                speech, beginning a meal, or even boarding a bus. The calligraphic bismillah is frequently written on both religious and 
                secular objects.
            </p>

            <p class="holy-book-para">
                The Qur'an places Muhammad at the end of a long line of prophets that began with Abraham. Although narrative is not central 
                to the Qur'an, it includes the stories of Noah, Moses, and Jesus. It recognizes Jews and Christians as "People of the Book"; 
                as a result, Muslims accept many of the teachings of the Jewish Torah and Christian Bible. Many of the great Islamic empires 
                (like those in Spain, Iran, India, and Turkey) were tolerant of religious minorities.
